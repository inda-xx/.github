## INDA Experiments

Here's some things to try or look at in your `xx-task-2` repos:
- Goto the issue tracker and post a 'help' issue (or read the one that is there) and trigger a workflow
- Goto the Actions tab and watch the workflows as they progress
- Read the source for:
  - `.github/workflows/dispatch.yml` - the main controller
  - `.github/workflows/handle_*.py` - the handler for each workflow
